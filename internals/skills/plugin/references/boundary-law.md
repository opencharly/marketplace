## The kernel/plugin boundary law — what belongs in the kernel vs a plugin

This is the authoritative detail for the project rulebook **"The kernel/plugin boundary law"** pillar. It decides,
uniformly and with NO per-kind exception, whether any schema / typed shape / validation / behaviour is
KERNEL (`charly/` core + `sdk/`) or PLUGIN. Read it before adding or placing any capability.

**The law.** The kernel is a **kind-blind execution substrate**: a construct is KERNEL iff it is one of
four kind-AGNOSTIC things —

- **(E) Envelope** — a generic carrier or the reserved vocab naming its slots: `#Node`(arm-less) /
  `#Step` / `#Op` / the `#Deploy` tree / the `InstallPlan` IR / `#Context`, and the wire replies plugins
  resolve into (`VenueDescriptor`, `EmitReply`, `BuilderResolveReply`, `DeployVenue`, `StepEmitRequest`,
  the opaque `Substrate json.RawMessage`). Carries opaque, word-tagged payloads; encodes no kind.
- **(M) Mechanism** — a generic engine that transports / renders / validates / re-materializes an
  envelope, dispatched **by word against a data table, never branching on a concrete kind** — and the
  ONLY M-mechanisms that live in `charly/` are plugin loading (the provider registry + transports +
  reverse-channel legs), prescan-dispatch (the SAME registry resolve+invoke a per-node kind-decode
  reaches, e.g. `provider_kind_invoke.go`'s `runPluginKind`/`foldSubstrateKind`/`foldCandyKind` — an
  elaborated CONSUMER of this mechanism, not a distinct one), and the wire broker. The FOLD/ORCHESTRATION
  half of kind-decode MATERIALIZE — deciding what to do with a resolved-or-unresolved node, the
  not-found policy — is NOT this mechanism: it moved to `candy/plugin-loader`'s `Materializer` seam
  (K1 unit 1, mirroring `ProjectWalker`/`DocParser`), so the in-core M set is now THREE, not four. Every
  OTHER kind-blind mechanism (parse, render, resolve, walk, engine) lives in an sdk KIT consumed by plugins:
  the config PARSE is `sdk/loaderkit` (plugin-served via the `DocParser` seam); the build engine, the
  deploy walk, the CUE-unify check, and the ledger currently in `charly/` are TRACKED MIGRATION
  INVENTORY with named K-wave exits (K3/K4/K5), never permanent M-residue. Canonical illustration:
  `loaderkit.ParseDoc` stays kind-blind by reading the `loaderkit.Threaded` kind-recognition snapshot
  — clause-D DATA threaded to a kind-blind mechanism, not a registry query. A kind-blind mechanism
  reached THROUGH a seam (a reshaper, the migration op-walker) is itself a PLUGIN/sdk-lib, NOT core.
- **(B) Bootstrap** — the single irreducible root that must exist before any plugin can load: the
  `candy`⊻`box` factory (`candyIsImage`+`buildCandy`) + the provider-registry seed. It cannot be a
  plugin without a bootstrap cycle (the discovered-candy pre-check calls it directly).
- **(D) Data-not-code** — a kind-recognition fact (which words are kinds / nest members / validate
  against which value-def) loaded from CUE/config and consulted by word: the CUE-derived vocab
  (`spec.OpVerbs`/`StepKeywords`/`DocDirectives`/`ResourceKinds`), the schema-version consts, the
  `#Migration` grammar, and the canonical example — `loaderkit.Threaded`, the 4-map DATA SNAPSHOT the
  host fills from the registry BEFORE the kind-blind parse (untying the loader↔registry cycle at zero
  abstraction cost — DATA threaded to a kind-blind mechanism, never a live registry query in the
  parse). NEVER a compiled-in per-kind Go branch or map.

- **(R) Resolve-to-envelope — the DEFAULT.** Everything else — a kind's schema, typed Go shape,
  deep-validation def, render/behaviour, and produced artifact — is a PLUGIN. It reaches the kernel only
  by **resolving** its config into an E-envelope that a Mechanism consumes.

**The decision procedure.** For any construct ask: generic Envelope (E)? a kind-blind Mechanism that is
plugin loading / prescan-dispatch / the wire broker (M — nothing else in core)?
the Bootstrap root (B)? kind-recognition Data (D)? If none → it is a plugin (R). Placement
is decided ONLY by this test; **difficulty NEVER enters it** (the project rulebook forbidden-excuse catalog) — a
thing stays kernel only because it is E/M/B/D, never because moving it is hard.

**The un-gameable self-test — the "incomplete seam".** The four kernel escapes are each kind-AGNOSTIC and
may never name a concrete kind in code. So a kernel `import` of a `spec.<Kind>` struct read for its
fields, a `switch` on a kind word, or a per-kind Go map is BY DEFINITION an R-item that leaked — an
**incomplete seam: a bug fixed immediately (one R10-gated cutover each), never a kept exception, never
parked as a "remaining candidate."** Those three tells are what you grep for.

**The named trap — "host-boundary object" is never a permanence reason.** Calling a construct a
"host-boundary object" — it "can't cross the process boundary," "drives podman/ssh/flock/systemd itself,"
or fits "the P8/P10 pattern" — is NEVER grounds to keep it in core. A plugin runs on the SAME host and
drives that object itself (exactly as `candy/plugin-vm` and `candy/plugin-kube` already do), or reaches a
live venue through the reverse-channel broker (M4, the `substrateLifecycle`/`ExecutorService` legs) —
needing the broker or the host IS the whole point of that seam, never a reason the construct must stay
core.

**Enforcement — the trap is checked, not just named.** A `// … STAYS CORE` / "cannot cross the process
boundary" header comment is a CLAIM, never a verdict on its own: a mover reports where each externalized
piece LANDED (never a bare "moved" claim) and gives any REMAINDER its own E/M/B/D justification, never one
inherited from the moved majority; a validator REJECTS a remainder whose only justification is a
stays-core header, demanding call-chain evidence first; and the orchestrator audits every stays-claim
against this boundary law with that evidence, never rubber-stamping the header. Precedent:
`charly/host_build_deploy_add.go`'s header states the `charly bundle add` CLI moved to `command:bundle`
(candy/plugin-bundle, P13) while the deploy KERNEL it drives "STAYS CORE" on exactly this "cannot cross
the process boundary" claim — overruled as a boundary-law violation (the deploy-dispatch kernel is
tracked K-wave residue, not permanent core). Full three-role breakdown: `/charly-internals:agents`
"Enforcement — 'host-coupled' is never a permanence reason".

**The defines-vs-calls test — the concrete grep that makes E/M/B/D un-mis-applicable.** To decide whether
a file is a genuine M-mechanism (kernel) or an R-item (moves), grep for where the mechanism is DEFINED —
the registry in `provider_registry.go`, the resolve+dispatch invocation in `provider_kind_invoke.go`, the
reverse-channel broker/`InvokeProvider` in `plugin_inproc*.go`/`plugin_dispatch_reverse.go`. A file that
only CALLS one of those — dispatches through `providerRegistry.ResolveVerb`, composes a live executor,
reads resolved config — is a CAPABILITY that USES the mechanism, not the mechanism itself: an R-item, it
moves. **This is the exact test that caught `materialize.go`'s own former "stays core, clause M"
self-classification (K1 unit 1): it never DEFINED the registry/dispatch mechanism, it only CALLED
`providerRegistry.ResolveKind` transitively — an R-item that self-misclassified. Its per-node NOT-FOUND
policy moved to `candy/plugin-loader`'s `Materializer` seam; only the TRUE mechanism it called
(`provider_kind_invoke.go`) stays core. A capability that uses M1–M4 is not thereby M1–M4.**

**Alias-is-always-residue — an alias is NEVER permanent, regardless of what it aliases.** A `type X =
spec.X` / `var y = spec.Y` re-export in `charly/` is ALWAYS an R-item under the ZERO-ALIASES v2 target,
REGARDLESS of what it aliases — even a genuine E-envelope type. The alias is not "permanent because it's
an E-type"; the alias IS the mislocated call site, the whole point of ZERO-ALIASES. Classify every
`charly/*_aliases.go` (and stray `_alias.go`) entry as residue: delete it and repoint its callers to
`spec.*` (or the owning kit) directly. Motivating incident: an auditor counted `labels.go`'s `BoxMetadata =
spec.BoxMetadata` alias and `install_plan.go`'s `Scope`/`Venue`/`Phase` aliases (all grep-verified genuine
`spec.*` E-types) as "permanent E," then self-corrected — an alias's TARGET being E doesn't make the alias
itself permanent.

**A concrete kind's typed shape is R, not E.** The (E) envelope bucket is ONLY kind-AGNOSTIC carriers —
`InstallPlan`, `VenueDescriptor`, `#Node`/`#Step`/`#Op`, the wire replies. A struct NAMED after a concrete
kind, with kind-specific fields and accessors — `Candy`, `VmSpec`, `ResolvedBox` — is that kind's TYPED
SHAPE: an R-item, moving to its owning kit/plugin (`Candy` → `sdk/buildkit`, alongside the
already-relocated `ResolvedBox`). "Carries data" is not the E test; kind-AGNOSTIC is. Motivating incident:
an auditor counted `layers.go`'s `Candy` struct (grep-verified: 60+ accessor methods, every one
kind-specific) as E because it "carries data," then self-corrected.

**The practical audit framing — invert the default.** Every file is an R-item (it moves to a plugin)
UNLESS it is LITERALLY one of the tiny kernel whitelist: the three in-core M-mechanisms (plugin loading /
prescan-dispatch / the wire broker), the B bootstrap root, D kind-recognition
data, or an E generic envelope. Auditing a cone by asking "is this hard to move" instead of "is this one
of E/M/B/D" is the exact failure this framing forecloses: the bed runner, the check/ADE harness, the build
engine, the deploy walk, and the VM engine are ALL R-items (the v2 ledger already names them plugins) —
none of them earns kernel status by being awkward to relocate. Motivating incident: two auditors
independently mis-classified the deploy + check cones as ~90% permanent using exactly the
"host-boundary/gather-engine" excuse; the true kernel in those cones is ~0.3%.

**The canonical shape every kind copies — resolve-to-envelope.** `builder` is the reference: its plugin
serves its own `#BuilderInput` schema, decodes into its own params, validates its own input, and RESOLVES
via `Invoke(OpResolve)` → `spec.BuilderResolveReply` (`Stage`/`CopyArtifacts`/`InlineFragment`); the build
engine splices the generic fragment and never imports a builder struct. Every concrete kind reaches the
kernel the same way — a distro resolves to install/phase/localpkg fragments, a substrate to a
`VenueDescriptor` + `InstallPlan`, a sidecar to a peer-`Deploy` fragment, a resource to a device fragment.
The kernel consumes the generic envelope; the plugin owns the schema, the validation (`OpValidate`), and
the resolution. The build-time `OpEmit` (step/verb fragment), the F6 lifecycle/preresolve legs a substrate
provider serves over its own `InvokeProvider(class:"deploy", word, OpPrepareVenue/OpPreresolve/…)`
(`VenueDescriptor`; S3b generalized this off the former dedicated `grpcSubstrateLifecycle` proxy into the ONE
generic `candy/plugin-bundle` `OpDeployDispatch` dispatch every substrate now shares), and the
`HostArbiter`/`HostBuild`/`InvokeProvider`/`RunHostStep` reverse legs are the
existing seams a de-typing rides — no new seam is usually needed, only the consumer stops re-typing.

**Every K-wave move is a generalization, not a mechanical relocation.** Moving a capability's call site
into its owning plugin is R3 ("no duplication; generic, reusable solutions over ad-hoc patches") and
Prioritize Clean Architecture applied to the migration itself (see the project rulebook — not restated here). In
practice: reach for an EXISTING generic seam first (`HostBuild`, `InvokeProvider`, `OpResolve`/`OpEmit`,
the substrate lifecycle/preresolve `InvokeProvider` legs, `OpDeployDispatch`) or build ONE generic, F11-reviewed, class-generic action noun — never a
per-word or per-case one; COLLAPSE per-case branches into a single word-keyed data-driven mechanism as
part of the move (per-substrate status collectors + a `switch node.Target` incomplete-seam become ONE
generic `OpStatusCollect`; per-kind `cue_kind` branches become one family); and DELETE every duplicate and
transitional alias the move obsoletes — never re-export it. Rule of thumb: reuse an existing generic seam
or delete the duplicate — rarely invent a new one; most seams the boundary law needs already exist.

**Realized architecture (present state).** The SDK boundary (`github.com/opencharly/sdk`) is extracted;
every verb / kind / step / builder / command, all five deploy substrates (local/pod/vm/k8s/android) with
their pod + vm venue lifecycles, and egress / k8sgen / gpu / arbiter / secrets / enc / tunnel are plugin
candies over the generic seams (`HostBuild("overlay"/"cli"/"step-emit")`, the `candy/plugin-bundle`
`OpDeployDispatch` orchestration + each substrate's own `InvokeProvider` lifecycle/preresolve legs (S3b,
replacing the former dedicated `grpcSubstrateLifecycle` proxy), the
`ExecutorService` reverse legs, the opaque `Substrate`/`DeployVenue.Substrate` payloads). Where a concrete
kind's TYPED shape is still consumed in core — a `spec.<Kind>` field-read, a `kindValueDef`-style per-kind
map, a substrate-word `switch` — that is a known **incomplete seam** being closed one cutover at a time
under this law; the active inventory + sequence live in the cutover plan + each repo's `CHANGELOG/`, never
as a snapshot here.

**Whole subsystems obey the same law.** A generic subsystem is kernel ONLY as one of the three in-core
M-mechanisms (plugin loading / prescan-dispatch / the wire broker); every other
kind-blind mechanism is an sdk kit consumed by plugins. The subsystems still carrying non-trivial core
weight — the build engine, the deploy walk, the OCI `registry.go`+`merge.go` (go-containerregistry), the
status subsystem, the LoadUnified orchestration, every `*_aliases.go` — are v2 migration INVENTORY, each
with a named K-wave exit (K1/K3/K4/K5), never permanent residue: where the boundary test says plugin, it
is an incomplete seam fixed as its own cutover with a named exit, never an indefinite candidate.

## Target architecture (v2) — the direction the boundary law drives toward

The boundary law above is the rule; this is the end-state it converges on. The project rulebook carries the mandate ("Core is a PLUGIN HOST"); this is its operationalization.

**The architecture, one sentence.** `charly/` core is a plugin host and nothing else — it loads plugins,
dispatches to plugins, and brokers the wire; it does not parse config, resolve, build, deploy, or check,
it does not consume the sdk mechanism libraries, and it contains zero aliases/shims.

**Three rules make this mechanically enforceable (the P16 triple gate checks all three).**

1. **Everything is a plugin.** Every capability — including the project loader, the deploy walk, the
   build engine, and the bed runner — lives in a plugin candy. Core's only jobs: discover/load plugins
   (compiled-in registry + go-plugin gRPC), prescan the CLI grammar from plugin-declared words, dispatch
   words→plugins (including the per-node kind-decode resolve+invoke a plugin's `Materializer` seam calls
   back into — the fold/not-found policy itself lives in `candy/plugin-loader`), and broker
   the reverse channel (venue executors + `InvokeProvider`). → P16 gate (a): the import-surface assertion (charly/import_purity_test.go — every charly/ file imports only spec/* + the proto/plugin-api contract + vetted third-party; the per-file allowlist is retired).
2. **Core does not import the sdk mechanism layer.** Core imports only the protocol contract — `sdk/spec`
   (wire types) + the proto/go-plugin packages + the Provider/Op vocabulary. `sdk/{kit,deploykit,
   buildkit,loaderkit,vmshared,…}` are for plugins. → P16 gate (b): import-purity (`charly/` has ZERO
   `github.com/opencharly/sdk` references — prod, test, and go.mod; the #55 terminus closed the last tracked residuals).
3. **Zero aliases/shims.** Every `charly/*_aliases.go` (`type X = deploykit.X`, `var y = kit.Y`) is a
   mid-cutover crutch that keeps a capability call site in core; the fix is never an alias — it is moving
   the call site into its owning plugin. → P16 gate (c): the `charly/*_aliases.go` glob is empty.

**Why the seams die.** Today's config-resolve / config-persist / oci-inspect
seams exist only because plugins could not load the project or touch the store. Once the loader is
`sdk/loaderkit` (the kind-blind parse) and state is the flock'd,
any-process-safe `sdk/kit` state family (`filelock.go` + `install_ledger.go` + `deployconfig.go`), a
plugin just loads the project itself — same filesystem, same library — and the seam
families collapse. The reverse channel then shrinks to the two things that genuinely cannot cross a process
boundary: **live venue executors** (re-materialized from `VenueDescriptor`) and **`InvokeProvider`**
(peer-plugin dispatch through the host's registry), plus plugin-binary/cli reentry. Everything else,
plugins do directly via sdk libs.

**Target kernel — the honest floor.** Roughly 3.5–4.5k LOC: `main()` bootstrap + the compiled-in plugin
registry + plugin cache/loading (~1k); the provider registry + in-proc/gRPC transports + prescan (CLI
words, kinds) + the per-node kind-decode resolve+invoke (~2k); the reverse-channel broker (executor
re-materialization + `InvokeProvider`, ~1–1.5k). Everything else in today's LOC total moves to sdk
mechanism libraries (loaderkit / enginekit + the existing kit / deploykit / buildkit) consumed by plugin
candies (plugin-project, plugin-build, plugin-bundle, plugin-check, plugin-box, plugin-status, plugin-oci,
the deploy-substrate plugins, the command plugins).

The active migration-wave sequencing and each wave's tracked residue exit live in the cutover plan and
each repo's `CHANGELOG/`, never as a snapshot here — a wave-by-wave ledger drifts the moment a wave lands.
P16 lands last, with all three gates green. GPU host-detection legs are the operator-dropped exception
(revisitable on hardware), not a K-wave item.
