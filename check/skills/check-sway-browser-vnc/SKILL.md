  The DISPOSABLE pod bed (check-sway-browser-vnc-pod) for R10 testing of the Sway

  live-container check bed for the sway stack.

# check-sway-browser-vnc

`check-sway-browser-vnc-pod` is the canonical **disposable** pod bed for the
live-container test verbs (cdp / wl / vnc / dbus / mcp / record) on the Sway
stack. It deploys the **shipping `/charly-selkies:sway-browser-vnc` image directly**
— there is no separate check image. It sits alongside the other `check-*` smoke
beds (`check-pod` — the combined image/layer/pod/DeployTarget mechanism bed —
and `check-local`) — all `disposable: true` deploys, top-level entries in their
project's `charly.yml` (this bed and `check-pod` in `box/fedora`; `check-local`
in main).

## Bed (a `disposable: true` deploy)

A check bed is just a deploy marked `disposable: true` — there is no separate
`check:` block. Each delta probe sway-browser-vnc doesn't bake is an ordered list
item under the deploy's `plan:` (named by its `id:`); mirror `box/fedora/charly.yml`:

```yaml
check-sway-browser-vnc-pod:
    pod:
        image: sway-browser-vnc      # the shipping image, deployed as-is
        disposable: true
        lifecycle: dev
        plan:
            - check: CDP /json/version answers over the published HOST_PORT
              id: esbv-pod-http-cdp
              context: [deploy]
              http:
                http: "http://127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT:9222}/json/version"
                status: 200
            - check: CDP enumerates the live debugging targets
              id: esbv-pod-cdp-list
              context: [deploy]
              cdp: list
            - check: the Sway tree is reachable over the Wayland socket
              id: esbv-pod-wl-sway-tree
              context: [deploy]
              wl: sway-tree
            - check: a terminal recording starts
              id: esbv-pod-record-start
              context: [deploy]
              record:
                method: start
                record_name: check-term
                record_mode: terminal
```

`disposable: true` is the sole authorization for `charly update`/`charly remove` to
destroy + rebuild the bed unattended (see `/charly-internals:disposable`). The bed
publishes `sway-browser-vnc`'s canonical ports `5900/9222/9224`, so it shares
those host ports with a real `sway-browser-vnc` deployment — only one runs at a
time (`charly box validate` notes this).

## Probe coverage

`sway-browser-vnc` already bakes binaries/services + cdp/vnc/wl/dbus checks,
and inherits the two `mcp:` probes from the `chrome-devtools-mcp` layer.
The bed's `plan:` steps above add the remaining deploy-context `check:` steps —
operator-side `http:` (CDP `/json/version` via `HOST_PORT`), `cdp: list`,
`wl: sway-tree`, and `record: start` — so a single `charly check live` run
exercises the full cdp/wl/vnc/dbus/mcp/record surface.

## Usage

```bash
# Canonical one-shot — the FULL R10 acceptance sequence (build → check image →
# deploy → config → start → check live → fresh update → tear down):
charly check run check-sway-browser-vnc-pod
# Or drive the steps manually:
charly config check-sway-browser-vnc-pod
charly start  check-sway-browser-vnc-pod
charly check live check-sway-browser-vnc-pod        # deploy-context cdp/wl/vnc/dbus/mcp/record
charly update check-sway-browser-vnc-pod && charly check live check-sway-browser-vnc-pod  # fresh-rebuild re-verify
```

Note: `charly config <key>` persists `image: <key>` (it assumes deploy-key ==
image-name; see `/charly-core:deploy`). Because this bed's key
(`check-sway-browser-vnc-pod`) differs from its image (`sway-browser-vnc`), set
the operator ref to `sway-browser-vnc` in `~/.config/charly/charly.yml` (the check
runner / `charly fleet add` does this for you — `charly` "never clobbers
operator-authored refs").

`check-sway-browser-vnc-pod` bed, or when running R10 verification for the Sway
desktop verb surface.
